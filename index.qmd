# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a demonstration and test of online lecture notes for an R-based
course or workshop. In this case the [Nonlinear Methods
Workshop](https://www.leuphana.de/institute/isep/psychologie-und-nachhaltigkeit/workshops/2024-jul-nonlinear-methods-for-psychological-and-social-sciences.html)
held at Leuphana University in LÃ¼neburg.

The lecture notes are written in Quarto markdown in Rstudio using the
Quarto book document format.

For a "normal" page, see  @sec-introduction. For a more advanced example
where the user can interact with a live instance of R, see @sec-interactive.

Note that references are handled nicely, and there is even a [PDF version](Nonlinear-Methods-Workshop-Lecture-Notes.pdf) of
the lecture notes that can be downloaded.

The book is fully searchable, and there is an option for users to annotate
both privately and as part of a group (but this is not enabled in the current
demonstration).
