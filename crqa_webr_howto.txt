Following this recipe:
https://r-wasm.github.io/rwasm/articles/rwasm.html#deployment-to-static-hosting


Running the r-wasm Docker image, I do the following in docker_r-wasm/ in a terminal

1. docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}/output:/output -w /output ghcr.io/r-wasm/webr:main R
2. In the R promt running in the docker instance in the terminal:
3. install.packages("pak")
4. pak::pak("r-wasm/rwasm")
5. library(rwasm)
6. add_pkg("danm0nster/crqa")
7. Now switch to the command line in this (nonlinear_methods_book) project
8. Run make & make deploy
9. ssh au78495@tildefiles.au.dk
10. Make sure that the directories in repo have the right permissions, e.g.:
11. chmod g+x emscripten
12. Make sure this loads: https://tildeweb.au.dk/~au78495/repo/bin/emscripten/contrib/4.3/PACKAGES
13. Now is should work at: https://tildeweb.au.dk/~au78495/NLM/interactive.html
14. To rebuild, delete files and start over from item 1.

IT WORKS!

Questions:

1. Can we rebuild without deleting and repeating everything?
2. IS there a way to fix the group permission bit issue?

This seems to work:

find repo -type d -exec chmod g+x {} \;

This command can be executed on the local computer, before pushing to the
server with make deploy.
